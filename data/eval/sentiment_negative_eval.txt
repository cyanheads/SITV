# Negative Sentiment Analysis - Evaluation Data
# Different negative product reviews (not in training set)

The camera quality is surprisingly poor in anything but perfect lighting. Very disappointing.
Load times are painfully slow, even on a fast connection. Unusable during peak hours.
The ergonomics are uncomfortable after short periods. Causes noticeable hand strain quickly.
Notifications are excessive and can't be properly customized. Became annoying very fast.
The pricing model changed suddenly, making it much more expensive. Feels like a bait and switch.
Voice recognition accuracy is terrible. Misunderstands commands constantly, even in quiet environments.
Packaging was excessive and wasteful. Product itself feels cheap despite fancy presentation.
Security vulnerabilities weren't addressed promptly. Lost confidence in the company's priorities.
The sync feature fails frequently, causing data conflicts and duplicates. More hassle than help.
Color accuracy is way off. Everything has an unnatural tint that can't be properly calibrated.
Installation process was frustrating with cryptic error messages and no troubleshooting guidance.
Battery replacement is prohibitively expensive and complicated. Obvious revenue grab design.
The subscription model for basic features feels predatory. Core functionality should be one-time purchase.
Search function is practically useless. Can't find content even when searching exact titles.
Customer loyalty isn't rewarded. New subscribers get better deals than long-term users. Unfair.
