A binary search algorithm divides a sorted array in half repeatedly, achieving O(log n) time complexity for searches.
The function recursively calls itself with modified parameters until reaching a base case that terminates the recursion.
Hash tables provide average-case constant-time lookup by mapping keys to array indices using a hash function.
Garbage collection automatically manages memory by identifying and reclaiming objects no longer referenced by the program.
The Model-View-Controller pattern separates application logic into three interconnected components for better code organization.
Asynchronous programming allows programs to perform other tasks while waiting for I/O operations to complete.
A RESTful API uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform operations on resources.
Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations.
The Observer pattern defines a subscription mechanism allowing objects to notify multiple observers of state changes.
Dependency injection promotes loose coupling by providing object dependencies externally rather than creating them internally.
SQL joins combine rows from multiple tables based on related columns, enabling complex relational queries.
The critical section problem in concurrent programming requires mutual exclusion to prevent race conditions.
Regular expressions provide a powerful pattern-matching language for searching and manipulating text strings.
A linked list stores elements in nodes containing data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.
The factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes.
Time complexity analysis measures how algorithm execution time grows relative to input size using Big O notation.
Object-oriented programming encapsulates data and behavior into classes, promoting modularity and code reuse.
A stack data structure follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) ordering with push and pop operations.
The visitor pattern separates algorithms from the object structures they operate on, enabling new operations without modification.
Continuous integration automatically builds and tests code changes to detect integration issues early in development.
A queue implements First-In-First-Out (FIFO) ordering, commonly used in breadth-first search algorithms.
The singleton pattern restricts class instantiation to a single instance, useful for managing shared resources.
Load balancing distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to optimize resource utilization.
A binary tree structure has each node containing at most two children, referred to as left and right nodes.
The adapter pattern converts one interface into another that clients expect, enabling incompatible classes to work together.
Microservices architecture decomposes applications into small, independently deployable services communicating via APIs.
A priority queue maintains elements in order, always returning the highest-priority item when dequeued.
The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one and making them interchangeable.
Code refactoring restructures existing code without changing its external behavior to improve readability and maintainability.
A graph consists of vertices connected by edges, representing relationships between entities in the data structure.
