# Negative Sentiment Analysis - Training Data
# Product reviews with negative sentiment

The subscription auto-renewed without proper notification. Frustrating dark pattern design.
App crashes constantly after the latest update. Lost important data twice this week already.
Customer service was unhelpful and kept redirecting me to automated responses. Waste of time.
The product photos were misleading. What arrived looks nothing like what was advertised online.
Battery drains incredibly fast, even on minimal usage. Barely makes it through half a day.
Interface is cluttered and confusing. Takes forever to find basic settings and features.
Quality control seems nonexistent. My unit arrived with obvious defects and scratches.
The premium tier isn't worth it. Features promised are buggy or missing entirely.
Delivery was delayed by three weeks with no communication or updates. Very disappointing.
Sound quality is tinny and distorted, even at low volumes. Expected much better for the price.
The smart features are gimmicky and unreliable. Connectivity drops constantly throughout the day.
Instructions were unclear and poorly translated. Had to search online for actual guidance.
Performance has degraded noticeably after just a few months of use. Planned obsolescence?
The free trial charged my card immediately despite claims of no upfront payment required.
Compatibility issues with standard devices weren't mentioned anywhere in the product description.
Build feels cheap and flimsy. Plastic components that should definitely be metal at this price point.
Customer support took days to respond, then provided a generic solution that didn't work.
The algorithm's recommendations are irrelevant and repetitive. Seems to ignore my preferences completely.
Privacy settings are buried deep and confusing by design. Data collection is way too aggressive.
Update broke core functionality. Features that worked perfectly yesterday now don't work at all.
The return process is unnecessarily complicated with multiple hoops to jump through. Anti-consumer.
Ads are intrusive and excessive, even in the paid version. Not what I signed up for.
Documentation is outdated and doesn't match the current version's interface or features.
Device overheats during normal use. Concerning for long-term reliability and safety.
The onboarding process is tedious and asks for unnecessary permissions repeatedly.
Material quality doesn't match the premium pricing. Feels like I overpaid significantly.
Integration with other platforms is broken. Promised features simply don't exist yet.
The learning curve is steep with no helpful tutorials. Unintuitive design choices throughout.
Frequent bugs disrupt workflow constantly. Can't rely on it for professional work anymore.
Marketing claims don't match reality. Specifications were apparently exaggerated or fabricated.
