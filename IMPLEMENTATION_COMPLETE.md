# ✅ Riemannian Geometry - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

## What's Been Implemented

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Fisher Metric Service (diagonal/KFAC/full approximations)
- [x] Geodesic Integration (RK4, exponential/log maps, parallel transport)
- [x] Riemannian Task Vector Service
- [x] Configuration integration with YAML
- [x] Data models extended (AlphaSweepResult + 3 fields, ExperimentMetrics + 9 fields)
- [x] Markdown reporting (3 new sections)
- [x] CLI banner shows geometry config

### Phase 2: ✅ COMPLETE - Experiment Integration
**Status**: Fully integrated with orchestrator and alpha_sweep

**What was completed**:
1. Modified `sitv/experiments/orchestrator.py`: ✅
   - Passes geometry service and Fisher metric to AlphaSweepExperiment (lines 382-406)
   - Already computes Fisher metric in `_compute_riemannian_metrics()` (lines 626-676)
   - Tracks Fisher computation time and Riemannian norms
   - Stores geometry config in metrics

2. Modified `sitv/experiments/alpha_sweep.py`: ✅
   - Added geometry service, Fisher metric, and geometry config parameters (lines 75-77)
   - Computes Christoffel symbols during initialization when geodesics enabled (lines 151-158)
   - Uses `apply_geodesic_task_vector()` when `use_geodesics=True` (lines 372-381, 471-508)
   - Displays geometry mode in run output (lines 216-221)
   - All geometry fields automatically populated via existing infrastructure

3. Base class `sitv/experiments/base.py`: ✅
   - Already has `apply_geodesic_task_vector()` method (lines 201-270)
   - Working and tested

## Current Status

**✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL - All components integrated**:
- ✅ Config loads geometry settings from `config.yaml`
- ✅ CLI shows geometry banner with metric type and RK4 steps
- ✅ Reports generate Riemannian sections with actual data
- ✅ All geometry services available and CONNECTED
- ✅ Orchestrator initializes geometry services when enabled
- ✅ Fisher metric computed from training data
- ✅ Geodesic interpolation used when `geometry.geodesic_integration.enabled=true`
- ✅ Christoffel symbols computed for geodesic integration
- ✅ Geometry fields in data models populated with real values
- ✅ Euclidean and Riemannian norms both computed and reported

## What Happens If You Run Now

```bash
python main.py
```

**✅ COMPLETE RIEMANNIAN WORKFLOW**:
1. Config loads with `geometry.enabled = true` ✅
2. CLI banner shows "Riemannian Geometry: ENABLED ★" with metric details ✅
3. After fine-tuning, Fisher metric is computed from training data ✅
4. Both Euclidean and Riemannian task vector norms computed ✅
5. Christoffel symbols computed for geodesic integration ✅
6. Alpha sweep uses geodesic exponential map: `exp_M_base(α·T)` ✅
7. Each evaluation applies task vector via Riemannian geometry ✅
8. Report includes Riemannian Analysis section with real data ✅

**Result**: Full Riemannian geometry pipeline from start to finish!

## ✅ Integration Complete!

All modifications have been completed. The Riemannian geometry system is now fully integrated.
